# Description

An expense tracker app built with React to further develop my skills and understanding of React.
I decided to go with an expense tracker because I wanted to try and build something that would be potentially useful for someone.

The expense tracker is suitable for desktops and mobile devices, making it useable across a wide range of devices.
The app keeps track of the expense item's name, the amount it was purchased for, and the date of the purchase.

## Future Enhancements

One of my main ideas for future enhancement is to include a 12-month graph, and show the amount expended for each month as a visual representation.

Next, I would like to implement a back-end system, such as a database and user logins, to store the expense data. However, for that I would need to learn thoroughly the back-end of development and security, which will take some time that I currently cannot allocate because of my Front-End and career priorities.
